            <h2 id="contentstart">How To Support Our Teachers</h2>
            <p>Teachers are the backbone to the future of our society. Not only do they teach our children and prepare them to be life-long learners and productive citizens, they provide emotional support, inspiration, motivation, and encouragement. Teachers often go beyond the call of duty, purchasing supplies and sometimes snacks for children that lack them or whose parents are not able to provide. In times of abrupt changes, such as natural disasters or pandemics, teachers must adapt to immediate changes that must take place in the classroom in order to normalise their students' learning experience. Technology has enabled these professionals to continue delivering education; however, sudden changes can produce uncertainty and anxiety navigating through various technologies and methodologies as in-classroom lectures must quickly transition into a virtual environment. This is a new concept for many teachers and students. Various educational and technology professionals have created resources that inform teachers on what educational technologies are available, how they can be used to deliver lessons, share templates, and provide a community of collegial support.</p>
                
            <p>For those outside of the profession, how can an educator be supported? By donating to services that coordinate donations for teachers and school supplies - such as <a href="https://www.adoptaclassroom.org">AdoptAClassroom.org</a>, becoming a parent volunteer, organising or working a school fundraiser, showing appreciation, and extending kindness to a teacher.</p>

            <h2>Resources:</h2>
            <p>The following resources aid teachers with technology ideas and tips for their classrooms. These fun technology spots are for teachers to form community with and feel supported.</p>
