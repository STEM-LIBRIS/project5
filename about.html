            <p>
               We are a group of educational professionals pursuing the problem of distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic through 
               strategic collaboration. While simultaneously completing our degrees in The Master of Library and Information Science program 
               at Wayne State University. 
            </p>
            <p>

               a required class for each of our programs.
