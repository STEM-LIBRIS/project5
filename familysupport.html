            <p>Parenting has always come with special joys and unique challenges, but parenting during the coronavirus (COVID-19) 
               pandemic has created its own unique challenges. With schools and workplaces closed, many families have found themselves dealing with new, and often very stressful challenges. Families are faced with possible financial insecurity, navigating how to work from home while homeschooling, caring and educating their children. 
               This family support page offers families essential resources needed to navigate these new challenges. 
               Below you will find resources focused on essential components to providing support and relief; stress management, 
               self care, and homeschooling/distance learning help.  The images below are clickable links: <br><br></p>
