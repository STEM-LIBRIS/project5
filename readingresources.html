		    <h2 id="contentstart">The Importance of Reading</h2>
            <p>Reading is perhaps the most important skill children learn in school.  It has benefits such as improving vocabulary, increasing general knowledge, improving cognitive abilities and empathy, and reducing stress. Reading can also help alleviate the symptoms of depression, strengthens your brain, and can prepare you for a good night’s rest.  Unfortunately, school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic have made it difficult for students to have the same level of access to books from their classrooms and school libraries. However there are many ways for students to continue reading, either physical books, eBooks, or audiobooks.</p>

	           <h2>Accessing Books and Reading Materials</h2>	    
            <p>Students may still access books from their school or public libraries.  Libraries have added new precautions and procedures to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to help ensure patron safety.  Based on recommendations from the CDC and The OCLC’s Project REALM, most libraries are quarantining books for five days before making them available for checkout. Schools can make physical books available to students by using the school’s online library catalog for student’s to place books on hold, or by using another method such as email for students to request certain books.  Books can then be pulled and checked out to students, then placed in a bag with the student’s name and left in a designated pickup area for students to retrieve.  A book drop can be placed in the same area for students to return books they are done with.  All incoming books should be quarantined before being placed back into circulation.  Students and families can check out books and materials from their public libraries in a similar manner.  Public libraries have their procedures posted on their websites.   Schools and public libraries also have virtual book clubs who may meet to talk about the same book, or whatever book people are reading.
